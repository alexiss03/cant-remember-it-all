A Notes App
===========
This is a personal project with the primary purpose to play around different technologies on iOS development which for now, 
I cannot immediately incorporate to my work's projects.

**Test-Driven Development**

I implemented this app with this mantra on my mind. I used the `Quick` as the BDD framework, and `Nimble` for the matcher.

**Linting**

To follow a specific style guide, I used the linter `Swiftlint` for this project. I disabled some rules due to personal preference.
